**Mission**

<!-- BLASTNet 2.0 was developed to provide the researchers in  reacting and non-reacting flow physics communities with high-fidelity simulation datasets in a convenient format for ML applications. With **2.2 TB, 744 full-domain samples, and 34 configurations**, BLASTNet can effectively address these gaps and aid in fostering open/fair ML development within reacting and non-reacting flow physics communities. -->
BLASTNet aims to address gaps in open machine learning (ML) within the sciences, specifically fluid mechanics by providing researchers in reacting and non-reacting flow physics communities with (mostly) externally contributed open-source ML resources. 

These contributions now include (i) 4.8 TB of high-fidelity simulation datasets that have been processed in a convenient format for ML applications, (ii) >13,000 lines of code that aid the training and evaluating of these models, and >100 pre-trained weights in flow physics problems.

**Application**

This data is useful for fluid flows in a wide range of ML applications tied to automotive, propulsion, energy, and the environment. Specifically, scientific engineering tasks related to these domains may include turbulent closure modeling, spatio-temporal modeling, and inverse modeling.

**Distribution**

To circumvent Kaggle storage constraints, we partition our data into a network of <100 GB subsets, with each subset containing  a separate simulation configuration. This partitioned data can then be uploaded as separate datasets on Kaggle. To download all cases via [Kaggle API](./tutorial.html), download [this bash script](./assets/bash/batch_download.sh). Summary of the data are avalable [here](./datasets.html)!
