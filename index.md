**Mission**

BLASTNet 2.0 was developed to provide the researchers in  reacting and non-reacting flow physics communities with high-fidelity simulation datasets in a convenient format for ML applications. With **2.2 TB, 744 full-domain samples, and 34 configurations**, BLASTNet can effectively address these gaps and aid in fostering open/fair ML development within reacting and non-reacting flow physics communities.

**Application**

This data is useful for fluid flows in a wide range of ML applications tied to automotive, propulsion, energy, and the environment. Specifically, scientific engineering tasks related to these domains may include turbulent closure modeling, spatio-temporal modeling, and inverse modeling.

**Distribution**

To circumvent Kaggle storage constraints, we partition our data into a network of <100 GB subsets, with each subset containing  a separate simulation configuration. This partitioned data can then be uploaded as separate datasets on Kaggle. To download all cases via [Kaggle API](./tutorial.html), download [this bash script](./assets/bash/batch_download.sh). Summary of the data are avalable [here](./datasets.html)!
