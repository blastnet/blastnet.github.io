abstract = {Three turbulent premixed flames with the same unstretched laminar flame speeds and thicknesses are analyzed and compared using 3D Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) in a slot burner configuration at atmospheric conditions: a CH4/air flame at ϕ=1, an NH3−H2/air (46% vol. H2) at ϕ=1 and an H2/air flame at ϕ=0.45. While both stoichiometric methane and ammonia-hydrogen flames behave similarly, the lean hydrogen flame brush is twice as short with less flame surface, and exhibits significant alteration of its local flame structure: for the H2 flame, the thickness of flamelets decreases significantly while burning rates increase drastically. This is observed for flame elements convexly curved with respect to fresh reactants (positive curvature) because of preferential diffusion, where thermo-diffusive instabilities generate long-tail structures that continuously head toward the fresh gases, and also for near-flat flame elements because of local strain effects. Opposite behaviors are observed for flame elements concavely curved (negative curvature) where fuel depletion caused by unfocusing of hydrogen and strain effects are unable to increase the consumption, even leading to near-extinction of the flame. The turbulent methane and ammonia-hydrogen flames studied in this work do not exhibit the instabilities seen in the pure hydrogen flame. However, local flame-flame interactions are observed in the cusp regions of all three flames, which significantly increase the displacement speed as well as flame surface destruction. A 1D-3D comparison indicates that strain effects in regions of low curvature and preferential diffusion effects in regions of positive curvature can be modeled using counterflow flamelets to account for stretch effects on the turbulent hydrogen flame propagation in addition to turbulent wrinkling.}
